# Day 2.5
* Finished the 30days of code challenge involving 2 d arrays.  
* Looked at the Haskell Matrix implementation that uses Data.Vector.   
* Realized Data.Array is complicated and best left alone.
* Had to use some sort of accumulator/stack to mimic array like behaviour with list.
* Decided to make Matrix class with List Backend instead and add eventual Tensor support.
* Learnt about Finger trees.
* The rest of 30 days of code is for java and c++ only.

* Decided to look into the following:
 * Do 30 days of code (day 10) involving binary numbers using the format in 302 assignment 1.
 * Implement Matrix add and mul,print, switch,fromList,print with nested-List backend
 * think about implementing Finger Trees, AVL trees, red and black trees, B trees in haskell.
