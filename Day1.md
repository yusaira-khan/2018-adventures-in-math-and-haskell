# Day 1

Today I start my haskell and math adventures.
But first, i must talk about my distro and environment.
## Environment
I'm currently using Arch with LXQT and Xmonad, depending on how lazy i'm feeling.
Decided to use urxvt as my terminal.
My arch machine has a fake hardwareclock since i can't find(read: too lazy to find) the kernel module for my current hardware.
Will probably use Stack and Sublime/vim for haskell, since too lazy to learn emacs.

## First order of business:
Setup haskell environment 
do the 2d array question on hacker rank with haskell.

## Second order of business:
* Setup Matrix Class 
* Init Matrices
* Print 
* Add Matrices
* Multiply Matrices

## Eventual orders of business(?):
* figure out category theory
